## Key Features Tested

### 1. End-to-End Analysis Workflow
- **Analysis Execution**: Tests complete stock analysis with history saving
- **Automatic Recording**: Validates that all analyses are automatically saved
- **Metadata Capture**: Ensures proper timestamp, session ID, and configuration storage
- **Error Handling**: Tests that failed analyses are also recorded appropriately

### 2. History Page Functionality
- **Data Retrieval**: Tests MongoDB queries with proper indexing
- **Pagination**: Validates efficient handling of large datasets
- **Real-time Updates**: Tests dynamic filtering and search functionality
- **Performance**: Ensures acceptable response times for large datasets

### 3. Search and Filtering
- **Multi-field Search**: Tests combined search across symbol and name
- **Market Type Filtering**: Validates filtering by US stocks, A-shares, HK stocks
- **Status Filtering**: Tests filtering by analysis status (completed, failed, etc.)
- **Date Range Filtering**: Validates time-based queries and indexing

### 4. Download and Export
- **Format Support**: Tests Markdown export (primary format)
- **Historical Metadata**: Validates inclusion of analysis date, execution time, cost
- **Content Accuracy**: Ensures exported reports contain all analysis components
- **Error Handling**: Tests graceful handling of export failures

### 5. Performance and Scalability
- **Large Datasets**: Tests with 50+ records to validate performance
- **Query Optimization**: Ensures queries complete within acceptable timeframes
